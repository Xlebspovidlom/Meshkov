.Introduction.

Production tool: RPG Maker 2000

This is a "Yume Nikki fangame".
This game does not have any connection to Yume Nikki.

Besides Yume Nikki, this game was inspired by other things
as well (such as iron pipes).

Please be warned that there is grotesque imagery in this game.

Please contact me if you find a bug or anything else strange,
I try my best to get rid of as many bugs as I can.

.How To Play.

Before playing, be sure you extract the .rar file.
After that, open the .flow folder and double-click flow.exe to
start the game. 

(NOTE: If you get an error message with a bunch of ?s,
you may need to either install AppLocale or set your system
locale to Japanese.)

Rather than a bed, you enter the dream world through a PC on
the desk. The bed is used for saving your progress.
